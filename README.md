# Library Borrowing System with Login Authentication

This is a simple front-end project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It simulates a basic **user login system** and a **library book borrowing dashboard**, designed for students to borrow books and manage borrowed records in the browser using `localStorage`.
